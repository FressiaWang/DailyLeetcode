"""
Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, 
return true if and only if this could have been the result 
of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
