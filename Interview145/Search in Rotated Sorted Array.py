"""
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Simple binary search with an additional check.
Comparing target with first element gives us information on witch part of array lies target: 
from begining to max or from min to end. In other words â€” left or right.
So, when our guess in the middle and our target lies on different sides, we know where to move

I found a very simple and easy understanding solution.

Since the array is sorted and rotated, we just need to make a binary searching.

Somebody may think it is hard because the array is rotated, but it doesn't matter actually!

We just to search it as a 'normal' sorted array.

We split the array into two segments from the middle, one is a normal array and another is rotated.

The we test the target to see which segment it would belongs to.

For a normal segment, which's begin is smaller than the end, the target should be larger than the begin element and less than the end.
For a rotated segment, which's begin is larger than the end, then the target should be larger than the begin element or less than the end.
Recursively split the array and search, finaly we will find out the target.
